# Welcome
This is a simple demo to explore [NextJS v6](https://nextjs.org).

Ultimately, I would like to see this project have parity with my previous NextJS 5 demos - [demo-nextjs-v5-without-typescript](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/demo-nextjs-v5-without-typescript) and [demo-nextjs-v5](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/demo-nextjs-v5). My initial goal is to start with a clean slate and see how new features and functionality in [NextJS v6](https://nextjs.org) can be incorporated.

# Getting started
## Initial setup and installation
To get started with [NextJS v6](https://nextjs.org), all you need to do is clone this repo and run the install script:

    $ git clone git@github.com:TheRobBrennan/demo-nextjs-v6.git
    $ cd demo-nextjs-v6
    $ npm install

## Start your local development server
Once you have cloned the repo and installed the required dependencies, you can start NextJS by running:

    $ npm run dev

Once you see `> Ready on http://localhost:3000`, you can view your app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

TIP: If you would like to run your application on a port other than the default `3000`, you can run:

    $ npm run dev -- -p <your port here>

Your development server will constantly reload as changes are made to your app.
